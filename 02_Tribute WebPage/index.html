        <h2 id="abh">Governor General of Pakistan</h2>
        <p id="abp"><b>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b> served as the first Governor-General of Pakistan from August 15, 1947, 
            until his death on September 11, 1948. In this pivotal role, Jinnah laid the foundation for the newly 
            independent state, providing strong leadership during its formative period. He focused on establishing 
            key governmental institutions, promoting unity among diverse ethnic and religious groups, and addressing 
            the massive refugee crisis following the partition of India. Jinnah's vision for Pakistan was a democratic 
            state with equal rights for all citizens, regardless of religion, caste, or creed. His tenure, though brief, 
            set the tone for Pakistan's political and administrative structure and left an enduring legacy on the nation's governance.</p>
